/// Parameters:
/// - allocator: memory allocator for dynamic allocations.
/// - trace: ArrayList of V arrays from Myers algorithm representing the path trace.
/// - a, b: slices of lines (original and new files).
/// - compare: callback function that compares elements at given indices.
/// - printDiff: boolean flag controlling whether to print the diff output.
///
/// Returns:
/// - Error if allocation or printing fails.
///
/// How it works:
/// - Uses the Myers diff algorithm's trace of vectors `v` to backtrack the path of
///   changes from end to start.
/// - Builds a list of diff operations (`DiffOp`) representing inserts, deletes, and matches.
/// - The backtracking reconstructs the diff in reverse order, so it reverses the operations list at the end.
/// - Optionally prints the diff using `DiffPrinter`.
