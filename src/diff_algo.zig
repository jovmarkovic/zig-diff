// A basic implementation of Myers' Diff algorithm in Zig.
// This computes the shortest edit script (SES) between two sequences,
// representing changes (insertions, deletions, keeps) to transform one sequence into another.
//
// The algorithm uses a dynamic programming approach with a "trace" of intermediate vectors (V arrays)
// that store the furthest-reaching points on each diagonal k at each edit distance d.
// The trace is essential for backtracking to reconstruct the actual diff operations.
//
// Reference: Myers, Eugene W. "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations." Algorithmica, 1986.

/// The trace stores snapshots of the vector V at each edit distance d,
/// where V[k + offset] stores the furthest x coordinate reached on diagonal k.
pub const Trace = std.ArrayList([]usize);

/// Computes the Myers diff trace for two sequences with lengths `a_len` and `b_len`.
///
/// - `allocator` is used to allocate temporary arrays and trace memory.
/// - `comparison` is a function that returns true if elements at given indices are equal.
///
/// Returns a trace of vectors that can be used to backtrack and reconstruct the diff.
///
/// The algorithm tries increasing edit distances `d` from 0 to max (a_len + b_len).
/// For each diagonal `k` from -d to d (step 2), it calculates the furthest `x` reached.
/// It then "follows the snake," advancing while elements match on both sequences.
///
/// Once the end of both sequences is reached (`x >= a_len` and `y >= b_len`),
/// the trace is returned for later backtracking.
///
/// Throws on allocation failures.
