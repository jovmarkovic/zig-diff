# zdif

A simple command-line diff tool written in [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) that compares two text files and outputs their differences in a format similar to the classic Unix `diff` utility.

---

## Features

- Compare two text files line-by-line.
- Supports ignoring lines starting with a custom marker (e.g., comments).
- Optionally skip empty or whitespace-only lines.
- Outputs differences using standard diff notation (`c`, `a`, `d`).
- Prints clear, human-readable diff output.
- Minimal dependencies â€” just Zig standard library.

---

## Usage

Build the project using Zig:

```sh
zig build
````

Or run directly without building:

```sh
zig run src/main.zig -- [options] <file1> <file2>
```

### Options

* `-m`, `--marker <text>`
  Remove lines starting with this marker (quotes allowed). Useful for ignoring comments or special lines.

* `-s`, `--skip-empty`
  Skip empty or whitespace-only lines from comparison.

* `-h`, `--help`
  Show usage information.

---

### Examples

```sh
# Compare two files normally
zig run src/main.zig -- testfile1 testfile2

# Ignore lines starting with '#'
zig run src/main.zig -- -m '#' testfile1 testfile2

# Ignore empty lines and lines starting with '//'
zig run src/main.zig -- -m '//' -s testfile1 testfile2
```

---

## Development

* Requires [Zig 0.14+](https://ziglang.org/download/)
* Uses Zig standard library only.
* Source files are in the `src/` directory.
* Build script: `build.zig`
